# Bowling Challenge

## Learning objectives
* Learn 

## Setup
```zsh
npm install

# For test cases and coverage
jest --coverage

# To run the project
node index.js # From project directory
```


## Built with
#### Main languages used:
* JavaScript
  * Used for the whole project
#### JavaScript modules:
* Readline
  * Used to retrieve and respond to user input
#### Testing environment:
* Jest
  * Used for the majority of the Test Driven Development throughout the test

## Testing coverage
* For unknown reasons, Jest branch coverage is missing certain lines, hence branch coverage is displayed at 97% for the project
* 100% coverage for statements, functions and lines according to JEST

## Key learning points 
#### What have we gained from the project

## Future developments
#### Which features and changes we would like to implement if we revisit the project, and how would we approach them?
* A HTML/JavaScript front end to run the project through a browser would be a logical next step
* Extra functionality for updating/deleting previous scores to be added in the future
